# Affordable Housing Project Explorer

## Instructions
* Run `npm run build` followed by `npm run start` to launch the app at `http://localhost:3000`
* Run `npm test` to test the app

## Implementation Details
* Built on [Next JS](https://nextjs.org/) for nice modern React defaults and SSR out of the box
* JSON is locally stored rather than `fetch`'d since new versions of [this data](https://data.sfgov.org/Housing-and-Buildings/Mayor-s-Office-of-Housing-and-Community-Developmen/9rdx-httc) are published annually
